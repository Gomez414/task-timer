# Task Timer

## Description

This Task Timer Project allows the user to create a list of current tasks they are completing. 

While they are doing a said task (or multiple concurrent tasks) a timer will be running, 
indicating how much time has past since the task was started. 

This will end once the user finishes said task, in which they can delete the task from their task list or keep it for record/summary. 

Once their tasks are done, of if they simply decide to, the user will aslo have the option to print out
a summary of their current time sheet. 

This will be able to be edited and exported as a csv file if desired. 

## Install

To install, clone the GitHub Repository and run uv sync.

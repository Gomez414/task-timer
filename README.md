# Task Timer

## Description

This Task Timer Project allows the user to create a list of current tasks they are completing. 

While they are doing a said task (or multiple concurrent tasks) a timer will be running, 
indicating how much time has past since the task was started. 

This will end once the user finishes said task, in which they can delete the task from their task list or keep it for record/summary. 

Once their tasks are done, of if they simply decide to, the user will aslo have the option to print out
a summary of their current time sheet. 

This will be able to be edited and exported as a csv file if desire. 

## Usage

The use of a Task Timer is completely up to the user. You can keep record of your
tasks, how long they take you, and see the statuses of complete or incomplete tasks.

By exporting to a csv file, the user may also keep themselves even more organized.
This will create columns of category and rows to fill them. Times will be included.
